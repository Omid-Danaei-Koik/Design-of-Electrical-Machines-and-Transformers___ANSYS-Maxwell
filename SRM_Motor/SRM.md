# SRM Design Project

## Overview
This project contains the design and simulation files for a Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM). The design is based on the book:
**"Switched Reluctance Motor Drives: Modeling, Simulation, Analysis, Design, and Applications"**

## Files Included
- **SRM**: Design and simulation files created in **ANSYS Maxwell**.
- **Book Reference**: "Switched Reluctance Motor Drives: Modeling, Simulation, Analysis, Design, and Applications.pdf"

## Software Used
- **ANSYS Maxwell**: Used for the electromagnetic design and analysis of the SRM.

## Notes
This project provides a detailed design and simulation of an SRM, which includes both 2D and 3D modeling in ANSYS Maxwell. The design parameters and analysis results are based on the referenced book. Ensure you have **ANSYS Maxwell** installed to open and run the simulations properly.
