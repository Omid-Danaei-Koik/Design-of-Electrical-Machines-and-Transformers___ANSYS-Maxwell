This repository contains the design and analysis of a constant speed DC motor with the following nominal values:

Speed: 2700 rev/min

Power: 1.5 kW

Voltage: 110 V

Overview
The design process includes the calculation of key motor parameters such as magnetic loading, electric loading, core dimensions, armature windings, commutator design, and field winding characteristics. The analysis has been conducted using ANSYS Maxwell to validate the electromagnetic performance of the motor.
