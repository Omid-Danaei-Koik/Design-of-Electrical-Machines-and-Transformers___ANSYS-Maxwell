# Transformer Design and Simulation

## Overview
This project includes the design and simulation of a **15 kV / 400 V, 400 kVA, 50 Hz** three-phase distribution transformer. The design parameters and calculations are based on standard transformer design methodologies, considering factors such as core flux density, window and yoke dimensions, and winding arrangements.

## Included Files
- **2D and 3D Simulation Files** (ANSYS Maxwell): These files contain the finite element analysis (FEA) of the transformer core and windings, providing insights into electromagnetic behavior and losses.
- **Dimension and Sizing Calculations** (PDF): This document outlines the detailed design calculations for core, winding, and insulation dimensions, ensuring compliance with performance and efficiency requirements.

## Key Features
- **Core Design:** Optimized for efficient flux distribution with a calculated cross-sectional area.
- **Winding Configuration:** Primary and secondary windings designed for optimal voltage regulation and thermal performance.
- **Electromagnetic Analysis:** Simulations performed in Maxwell to validate design parameters and identify potential improvements.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to transformer design, integrating theoretical calculations with practical simulations for performance validation.
